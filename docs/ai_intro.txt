Artificial Intelligence, or AI, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions. AI systems can perform tasks such as understanding natural language, recognizing images, solving problems, and making recommendations. Modern AI relies on machine learning and neural networks to improve over time by learning from data.
